Yeah that was a working car at one point but now it needs a new radiator and spark plugs.

Shoes are damaged. Duct tape.
Ooh, bag of rice. 94% too.
Oh baby, water pump.
My little monster is getting impatient with me. She's munchin' on the corners of my boxes.
Little monster!
Alright, belly's full.
Belly's full.
Yeah the benefit of having rope is to make a fishin' rod.
From there you gotta dig up a worm, unless you're playing on a really cold map.
But yeah you can also tie people up with the rope, and a few other things with it too, make a backpack, and a few other things.
 so we got a railroad track, and we have a road.
Yeah, my cat looks... I don't want to say 'common' but she kinda looks like a raccoon.
If you just saw her tail stickin' out from behind a dumpster, you'd think there was a raccoon back there.

Chicken.
All we gotta do is find a radiator and fill it up with water.
Wait a minute, another car?
Maybe they're spawning them close to the towns so people don't have to go huntin' for 'em.
Wait a minute, what's wrong with the car?
Oh maybe it's still too low on water, it was just a little water bottle.
9 millimeter. Rubbers. More rubbers.
Oh shit, another radiator.
Yeah I don't know, maybe they think that if you came through all that lag, you get a car.
Someone stashed a repeater. No shots.
Whatever, maybe we'll just share the same stash.
Yeah true, we could probably drive it to a well, wherever that is. I'll bet it's right here in the centre.
Oh there it is.
Ooh what is that?
The chemosee map.
Alright it might be easier to pull around here.
Shit!
Please die, lady.
Ok we should be able to drive it down there before it blows up.
Then we can take a little driving tour before we get shot in the face.
No, no, no, everything's gonna be fine. Just take it real slow.
Shit we're probably real low on gas too.
I think there's a spare tyre in the back.
You think it's ok?
I mean, shit, we're just gonna take it on a little cruise, try to get to the end of the map.
How many of these do you think it's gonna take?
We'd have to do the same thing with the other car to get it over here, right?
The radiator thing is kinda a ball-buster.
Yeah yeah I'm not too worried about the gas thing. Let's just get to a gas station.
No I think once you take the radiator out, it's empty. You gotta fill it up again.
I'm gonna flash-bang you, get ready to close your eyes. 1-2-3.
Maybe next time we'll try to get all the way down to Chiemsee.
Nice.
Alright let's see if this is good enough for a bit.
Maybe grab that repeater too.
Oh, it's not smokin'. But the engine light is on. Is that because it's almost dead?
You're trying to run me over man?
How long is it gonna be before you try to kill me?
I think I hear somebody else. You with somebody?
There's another one of these parked over here, man.
Do you have any water? I gotta find a well.
I feel like the radiator thing is a bit of a bummer.
Nope, can't do that.
We've done much worse than that crash, and never had a radiator die that quickly.
Wait a minute, who the fuck is... Who's out here?
Oh my gosh, you scared me so fuckin' much.
You got any water for this? You're a scary-lookin' dude, why don't you come with me. Let me show you where the car is, here it is, it's right over here.
Let me get some water.
Haha what the fuck.
The car is missin' a radio, maybe he can do a little sing-along for us.
Maybe he'll get some tyres for us.
It's cool mate, I don't need to go with you guys in the car.
A little bit.
Do you have another container, maybe I can get water too.
You got any 9 millimeter?
I have 17 bullets for that, you want em?
Oh he's got .22 rounds.
I got meat if you guys need it.
Where you guys from, man?
I'm from South Africa, bro.
Bob-Steve? Steve-bob.
Ok I'll see if they're better at drivin'. I don't have to drive.
When do you think we can actually drive that thing down to the pump?
I got an empty repeater stashed in a bush.
You got any other guns, you got like a pistol or something?
I'm willing to be the bigger man here, and squash it.
Or...
Nah, he's chill.
Alright we can probably drive this thing over.
Yeah I think I think I think I think it's full.
Yo, step aside, dude.
Looks like a chop-shop over here.
You guys good at drivin'?
I've never driven.
I'll start us off.
Where did you get your drivin' license?
Can I put something on my face that will like, stop you guys from getting sick?
Possibly.
Prepare for impact.
Oh! Is that a man?
No it's a zombie.
Whoa, was that a bomb?
Fuck her up!
Ah, perfect, the missing piece.
Is there anything else?
You guys wanna go back and get that repeater?
How's this other one lookin'?
Oh it's real low on gas and the engine's fucked.
I'm gonna look real quick at the map for a gas station.
Alright let's roll.
This guy's poppin' pills.
Wait, I think we good to go back, probably.
This takes us to the swamp, doesn't it?
Yeah I spawned in the swamp, mate.
He's like,"I lived in the swamp, mate".
Don't forget to leave me a Yelp review.
Do if you press N, you can enable your earplugs.
Life-changing ay?
I think we're passin' through this town.
Wait a minute, are we tryin' to go around?
You watch football, man?
I support Man United, mate.
Steve, you watch any sport mate?
I got no rags. Here cut up my mask.
This way you guys shouldn't get sick, right?
Alright someone's got that scorpion, right?
Alright I'm gonna put my blaze in the car.
Left or right?
Right.
Beep.
I'm really sorry for interrupting with interrupting. 
Silly bastard. Alright I'm gonna watch over the vehicle.
How high, that's crazy mate.
Oh! There a military zombie lookin' at us.
You guys loot around, I'll stay near the vehicle.
Are you sure?
I mean, look.
Take what you can.
Beard check? I got I little something going here.
I been out here surviving.
Survivin'.
Does anybody here need a backpack backpack?
Flash bang.
Does anybody here need a backpack?
Backpack backpack wack wack it can somebodying tack tack sack clack flak.
That fork is a good zombie-killer.
Ooh, that might be a dead zombie down there.
We haven't been down there yet, and that right there is a dead zombie.
I saw some hand-wraps lying there, I saw some bones lying there.
Let's get our boy.
We gotta get gas. Probably should have just stayed put. Repeato gone? Is his name Pete-o? There's a guy down there, he talked to me. Not at all. What'd he say?
I just run, I was scared.
You were obviously taught from a young age not to talk to strangers, were you?
There's two guys over there, that looks dangerous.
Looks like they're going for that deer, should we just kill them?
I haven't seen anyone for hours and all of a sudden the server's packed, it seems.
I'm gonna follow this road, what do you say?
Do we have armour to kill them?
This is like a big nuclear-looking place.
Pete-o is a Spaniard.
There we go!
I'm just practicing my James Bond moves, dude, ok?
Wanna go down there?
That's the thing.
What's your blood at?
How'd you get so bloodied up?
That wasn't you?
It was me.
I ate some man-steak and you just shot me.
I was lookin' at a freshie and you fuckin' executed me on the spot.
Thanks dude.
You literally just painted the perfect picture of what actually happened.
It's a work in progress
It's a WIP. I'm jokin', I'm jokin', I just wanted to rub it in.
Can you put this on the SPT? Would you like the SPT mate?
I have something against it, I like it, but I just don't want to use it.
I was not aiming at your head...
I'm gonna recommend you.
To a military zone.
On the way.
You actually don't know where you are going?
I got a GPS.
Very smooth. It's very great.
Ill give you my shotgun.
Why I can't get out?
Two doors can't open at the same time, it looks like.
So you have to wait for one to get out.
One for you.
Oh arm-bands?
Arm bands.
One for you, two for me.
We gotta go to the gas station, you know that, right?
Don't make me sleepy dude, I'm at the end of my rope here.
It's 12pm here.
Midnight?
No! Not midnight.
Oh, it's midday?
I'll bet you were playing DayZ.
Nope, I was working.
Come on.
Where's he going? Get in the fuckin' car dude, just gimme a second chance.
If you had died there, I would have taken your shit so fuckin' quick dude.
It's the American that brings us together with the decent ping.
I was heart-broken, you killed my mate.
My mate runs over there and gets instantly assassinated.
I needed to go fishin' with his bones.
Maybe he shouldn't invade someone's personal space.
I've never drived before.
Stop stop stop. Down shift.
Back us up, and spin us.
One two three, stick us on two, dude, otherwise this'll be a short trip.
All I can say.
Maybe go the other way that we haven't already been.
Do you wanna swap seats?
That's cool, I'm happy in the back mate.
Can you swap to the other seat, behind me?
If we crash I'm gonna go to bed.
Forgive me if I'm quiet bro, I'm just fearin' for my fuckin' life.
Look at these trees bro, can you imagine hitting one of these at high speed?
C'mon man, look at this?
I mean we have to go to South?
Unfortunately while we're driving I can't pull out a compass.
The thing is we have to go back the other way.
I'm gonna stop, then I'm gonna get out.
Look at the zombie!
You're trying to kill me, bro.
Where's the South?
The South is over there.
We're gonna follow you. I can't get in.
Maybe it's for my backpack.
Doesn't give me an option mate, there's no option to get on.
I just wanna try this thing for about ten minutes, alright?
Let's go let's go!
Alright if we get shot at, our buddy here is dead.
I notice you can give the bird while you're on the bike.
You found your military base dude, nice..
He's sleepin' haha, oh shit, I got an idea.
The bicycle, it's my get away vehicle.
Alright it's been real, boys. *pedals away*
Yo, there's more military tents over here.
Say again?
There's military tents.
Who's the driver? Now I'm gonna push this.
Well? Well? Am I a fuckin' genius or what?
You think you're so fuckin' sweet.
Let me push this.
I just have the start engine option.
Can you tie me up from there? Do you guys have something to tie me up?
Try reverse, brother.
The moment we touch one of these logs, we're fucked.
Imagine the person that comes across us now, what would that person think?
Trust the process. Call the experts.
That bicycle is pretty sweet, we should keep it in the car.
Oh shit, I'm on the back.
Ok, how the fuck do we get out of here.
Trust the process.
Shut the fuck up for a second, give me a minute to work.
This guys killing himself.
I don't know where to go. I'm gonna launch myself into the fuckin' woods though. Let's see if we can fuckin' get out of the spawn zone here.
I can't tell if the fuel is actually going down, or is it infinite?
Oh shit, there may have been an accident.
It was so simple when I loaded that thing in, why can't you get the fuckin' bike in?
It wasn't stickin' out of the back before.
Yo, forget the bike, let's go.
You fuckin' donkeys.
Oh, shit.
There we go, did you see that?
I lead the way again? Yeah you got the better vehicle man.
I want to go South, which way is South?
Look I'll tell you what, I got time to hit up...
I got an ingame map, just lead the way.
I don't want you runnin' me over.
Don't say anything, I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing.
Thanks for all the big resubs, dudes. Sorry it's hard to look away while I'm driving.
Southwest is left. Right is northeast.
Uh-oh.
This actually feels pretty smooth. We're doing 65.
Uh-oh, my engine light's blinkin'.
I think we're going in a circle, over and over and over.
Yeah we've been here,
Steve! We need your directions.
What are those three things in that direction over there.
You got a hitch-hiker, mate.
Let's go left.
Somebody give me fuckin' directions. Are we going this way?
Let's go this way.
Straight or right?
I think it's straight.
Careful of the lips here, they're extra thick.
Wait a minute there a sign over there.
Yes, you dirty-minded little bastards.
Oh there's a sign here.
Where are we?
I'll bet you this priest is a catholic.
Flash bang you guys.
Bad enTKOFR.
Military camp. Gimme two seconds, I'm going to exit out of this map and take one of my three shotgun shells and put it in your face.
Where's the big mill-base we can take them to?
I'm wasting my gas, man.
Is that the one where we got stuck though?
It kinda looks like that same square layout.
We're already in the Northwest corner.
I'm just gonna take us to that little military camp.
So you're makin' fun of me, but you can't read, is that it?
Let's go Southwest, we'll check out the military camp.
Now I gotta walk my arse all the way over here, thanks guys.
Wait a minute there's two guys!!
Let's just spy on em for a sec.
He's got the shotty, it's all on you guys.
He's peekin', he's peekin'.
He might have a gun out, watch out!
Our buddy's aimin' his gun straight up in the air. I think he's bugged.
We gotta get a fire-axe, or something, here we go.
I dropped my damn pitchfork.
All this meat's gone bad, damn it.
Now I'll just cut up that chicken.
How'd it go? Did you find that guy? Did you lose the other one?
I'm just gonna put some chicken in your car then I'll be back.
Did you check his body yet?
You should have the arm band, that I made for you.
I'll get it when we get back to the car.
Oh, no I have it here!
Oh my gosh, they have food for old people.
They have BK as well.
BK ammo for you.
Go ahead and take a few shots. There's plenty of shit there.
Holy shit there he is! Wait I think it's a third dude?
He's gonna take the car! Take a shot!
Oh shit my MK is out. He's takin' the car! Shoot him!
Haha nice shooting, we almost got him.
He yoinked it dude. Maybe we can follow him.
Turn off the engine, that might be it.
Can you get on now? Here I'll get off.
This shit, this shit is buggy.
You gotta get like the perfect... Here I almost had it.
There's the car! It's the guy!
I can't believe we drove behind this little ruin and he's parked our car.
Unlucky for him, damn.
What are the chances?
This is literally my first time playing this map.
Why is he looking at the sky all the time?
I'm not looking at the sky brother.
Yes you are, all the time. Look at him, walking up the road.
Nice.
Wolves. Here they come.
I gotta put a battery in this red dot.
you guys got any more 9 millimeter?
I think I keep asking you guys that.
He's got some food we can eat.
I wonder if he stashed something like a spark plug.
Nope, we got everything.
He's underfire, makes it away, he almost makes it away, then we see him.
He'd be talking to his buddy in Discord,"dude I got their car!"
We can eat those wolves now.
My beautiful car.
If you guys wanna make one more attempt at it.
Careful behind.
This is gonna go bad.
You're good.
Couldn't tell if that was his engine, or a shot that we heard.
Ok, real quick I'm gonna open this map.
Let's go South of this.
I just found a box of 7.62x54
Server restart in about 5 minutes.
We can check out that military spot after restart.
I'll see you guys after reset.
I didn't realise reset was so close.
Was it for my bike?
I'm fine with that.
It's been real, I'll see you after restart though.
I'm not sayin' we're not taking this seriously, but we're just messin' about here tonight to test this new map.
Gimme about 10 minutes to get some food, then we'll be back.
I need to get off, I'm so fuckin' tired.
Alright gnight.
