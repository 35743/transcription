# transcription
This is a repo for my stenography practice transcripts of Twitch streamers, YouTubers, movies, shows, etc.  
I find that streamers playing videogames have a wide variety of verbal cadence and narrative styles as they play the game and engage with their chat.  
At my current level, the steadily paced monologue of certain gamers is punctuated by the occasional outburst during frantic moments. It is great stenography practice.
